/*
 UIAccessibility
 
 UIAccessibility is implemented on all standard UIKit views and controls so
 that assistive applications can present them to users with disabilities.
 
 Custom items in a user interface should override aspects of UIAccessibility
 to supply details where the default value is incomplete.
 
 For example, a UIImageView subclass may need to override accessibilityLabel,
 but it does not need to override accessibilityFrame.
 
 A completely custom subclass of UIView might need to override all of the
 UIAccessibility methods except accessibilityFrame.
 */

 Returns the localized label that represents the element. 
 If the element does not display text (an icon for example), this method

 a button that is used to play music. "Play button" should not be used, since there is a trait
 that identifies the control is a button.

/*
 UIAccessibilityContainer
 
 UIAccessibilityContainer methods can be overridden to vend individual elements
 that are managed by a single UIView.
 
 For example, a single UIView might draw several items that (to an
 end user) have separate meaning and functionality.  It is important to vend
 each item as an individual accessibility element.
 
 Sub-elements of a container that are not represented by concrete UIView
 instances (perhaps painted text or icons) can be represented using instances
 of UIAccessibilityElement class (see UIAccessibilityElement.h).
 
 Accessibility containers MUST return NO to -isAccessibilityElement.
